	<p>Junior year was one of the hardest of my academic years filled with stress, tests, class discussions, and growth. Taking 6 wheighted classes, I've learned more this year than I probably ever have in my entire life. Taking AP US History, I learned how to take notes and how to study effectivley and learned how to share my perspective in class discussions in honors english. This year was a hard one but I wouldn't change anything if I could. </p>
